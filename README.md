### Hi I'm [@ezrantn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezrantn/) (Ezra Natanael) 👋

I'm a Software Engineer from Indonesia. 🇮🇩

I enjoy creating open-source tools, such as [@macshift](https://github.com/ezrantn/macshift) and [@zli](https://github.com/ezrantn/zli)

Currently, I'm working on:
- [@steg](https://github.com/ezrantn/steg) a CLI steganography tool
- [@ranko](https://github.com/ezrantn/ranko) a mini search engine 🔍

My primary programming language is Go, but I also work with other languages. 👨‍💻
