# Ezra Natanael 👋

As a backend developer, I craft engaging projects and relish the sense of creativity.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Tech Stack

Hey there! I'm all about backend work with Go and NodeJS. Been Docker dabbling for a year, ensuring smooth sailing. Data's my thing: SQL (Postgres, anyone?) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis, you name it). Plus, I'm a Fedora fan for daily Linux hangs.
