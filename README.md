#### Hi, I'm [@ezrantn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezrantn/) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. I mainly work with Go, but I also explore Rust for hobby projects.

Iâ€™m passionate about distributed systems, databases, and building tools that make developersâ€™ lives easier.

I created open-source projects like [Vex](https://github.com/ezrantn/vex), [Macshift](https://github.com/ezrantn/macshift), [Steg](https://github.com/ezrantn/steg) and many more.

Check them out, and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezrantn/) if you want to chat or collaborate!
