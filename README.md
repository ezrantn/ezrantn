### Hi I'm [@ezrantn](https://x.com/EzraNatanael6) (Ezra Natanael) 👋

I'm a software developer from Indonesia. 🇮🇩

I build APIs and open-source tools like [@gopiah](https://github.com/ezrantn/gopiah) and [@tweetify](https://github.com/ezrantn/tweetify).

I'm currently working on [@jane](https://github.com/ezrantn/jane) a NoSQL database from scratch inspired by the Bitcask paper. 📝

My primary coding languages are Go and TypeScript, but I'm also familiar with other languages to some extent. 👨‍💻
