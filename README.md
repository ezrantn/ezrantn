### Hi, I'm [@ezrantn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezrantn/)

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. Most of my day-to-day work is in Go, but Iâ€™ve been having fun with Rust for hobby projects and recently started tinkering with Clojure just to mix things up.

Iâ€™m into distributed systems, databases, and building tools that make developersâ€™ lives easier.

Letâ€™s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezrantn/) if you want to chat or collaborate!
