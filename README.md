# Ezra Natanael 👋

I am a fullstack developer, specialize in backend development, crafting engaging projects, and relishing the sense of creativity.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Tech Stack

Hey there! I'm all about diving deep into the backend with Go and NodeJS, while spicing up the frontend with some ReactJS magic. Been tinkering with Docker for about a year now, making sure everything runs smooth as butter. And when it comes to data, I've got SQL (Postgres, anyone?) and NoSQL (MongoDB and Redis, I see you!) covered. Plus, you'll often find me hanging out in the Linux world, chilling with Fedora for my day-to-day stuff.
